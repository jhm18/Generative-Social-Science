David Heise's (2013) Groups Simulator & Nikolas ZÃ¶ller's (2020) ACT Based Simulation of Interaction in Networked Groups (ACTING) are implemented in Netlogo and Python respectively.

This directory contains R and Julia scripts for calling these simulations, running batch experiments, and working with simulation outputs.
