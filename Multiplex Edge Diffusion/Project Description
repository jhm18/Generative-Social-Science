The files in this directory are a user file and simulator for a multiplex network diffusion implemented in R that extends Jim Moody's SAS based MR Edge Diffusion routine.
The simulation supports running SI, SIR, and SIS infection processes. The user can specify relation specific diffusion probabilties, specifiy user specific infection latencies.
The simulation produces an infection history, visual outputs, and a infection animation.
