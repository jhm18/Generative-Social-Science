This directory contains a modularity sweep routine based on Weir, W. H., Emmons, S., Gibson, R., Taylor, D., & Mucha, P. J. (2017). 
Post-processing partitions to identify domains of modularity optimization. Algorithms, 10(3), 93.    

The routine also borrows heavily James Moody's SAS implementation, in particular the Convex Hull visualization.

For the orginal Python version go to: https://github.com/wweir827/CHAMP

This routine produces both a resolution sweep and Adjusted Rand Score optimality analysis.
