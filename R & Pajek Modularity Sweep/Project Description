This directory contains a modularity sweep routine based on Weir, W. H., Emmons, S., Gibson, R., Taylor, D., & Mucha, P. J. (2017). Post-processing partitions to identify domains of modularity optimization. Algorithms, 10(3), 93.    
For the orginal Python version go to: https://github.com/wweir827/CHAMP

This routine produces both a resolution sweep and Adjusted Rand Score optimality analysis.
