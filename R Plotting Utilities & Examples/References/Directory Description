This directory contains references for visualizing data using R Graphics and with Grammar of Graphics (ggplot2).

The PlotsR-manual is a very nice compendium of R Graphics plotting capabilities. 
I highly recommend it for instances where ggplot2 design assumptions are prohibitive, but you still want to plot using R.
